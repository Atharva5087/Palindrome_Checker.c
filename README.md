🪞 Palindrome_Checker.c
📘 Overview

This program checks whether a given word is a palindrome — a word that reads the same forwards and backwards (like madam or racecar). It uses a clean and efficient function-based approach with character comparisons.

⚙️ Features

Takes input from the user using fgets()

Removes newline characters automatically

Checks palindrome using a simple logic loop

Demonstrates the use of functions and string traversal

🧠 Logic

Count the length of the string manually.

Compare characters from the start and end of the string.

If all corresponding characters match → it’s a palindrome.

Otherwise → it’s not.
